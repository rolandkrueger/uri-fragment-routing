URI Fragment Routing
====================

This library provides a framework for mapping URI fragments as found in URIs such as `http://www.example.com/shop#!signin` on custom actions. For example, the URI fragment `signin` could be mapped on an action class `GoToSignInPageAction` which will be executed when the user visits this address.

This is useful for single-page applications where the application state is typically encoded in the URI fragment. For example, the following URI might by used by an application to show the user a product detail page in some web shop. 

`http://www.example.com/shop#!/products/group/books/id/4711/view`

Here the part `!/products/group/books/id/4711/view` forms the URI fragment that carries an application's current state. As you can see, such a URI fragment consists of a directory-like path structure. This structure may additionally contain parameter values such as ids, categories, or coordinates. Since URI fragments are pushed to the browser history, they allow for writing navigatable web applications that support the browser back button and deep linking.

Web applications typically use a large number of such fragments in order to allow users to navigate to the different parts of an application. Beside navigating to some sub-view, a URI fragment could also be responsible for changing the state of a UI component visible on a view. For instance, you could bring a particular panel of a panel stack to the foreground with a specific URI fragment.

When using URI fragments for encoding application state, you're facing two problems that have to be solved. Firstly, a URI fragment visited by the user has to be parsed and interpreted. Parameter values have to be extracted from the fragment, they need to be converted and validated, and finally have to be passed to the code that is responsible for handling the fragment.

Secondly, valid URI fragments have to be generated from the application state so that they can be used for creating HTML links. These two tasks have to be kept consistent throughout the code base of an application so that URI fragments generated in one part of the application can be interpreted by other parts of the application. If the structure of the URI fragments is changed during application development, this has to be reflected everywhere a URI fragment is generated for a link.

This library helps you with this task. Following is a list of features that are provided:

# Features

* Mapper objects map individual path segments of a URI fragment on an action class.
* The set of mappers defined for an application is kept in a tree-like data structure (*mapper tree*) reflecting the directory structure of the URI fragments.
* Use a convenient builder class to construct a full mapper tree guided by the code completion feature of your IDE.
* For every URI fragment path segment, a set of parameters can be defined which will be interpreted when handling a particular URI fragment visited by the user.
* Parameters can be single-valued (e. g. an ID) or multi-valued (e. g. a pair of coordinates).
* Parameter values are converted from their String representation in a URI fragment to their respective domain types using converter classes.
* Use different parameter modes: directory style with names, directory style without names, query style.
* Generate fully parameterized URI fragments for individual mappers from the mapper tree to be used in HTML links.
* The URI fragment interpretation process is thread-safe so that only one mapper tree object has to be instantiated per application.
* Requires Java 8 and supports lambdas.

# Examples

Following are some usage examples that show how to use this library for a simple scenario.

## Single path element with parameter

Consider the following URI: 

`http://www.example.com#!profile/user/john.doe`

The URI's URI fragment `profile/john.doe` (the exclamation mark in the beginning can be ignored for our purpose) consists of a single path segment `profile` and a String-valued parameter with name `user`. The parameter's value is `john.doe` in this example.

Let's see how we can build the mapper tree for this fragment:

```
AbstractUriPathSegmentActionMapper[] mappers = new AbstractUriPathSegmentActionMapper[1];

UriActionMapperTree mapperTree =
   UriActionMapperTree.create().useParameterMode(DIRECTORY_WITH_NAMES).buildMapperTree()
      .map("profile").onAction(ShowUserProfileCommand.class)
      .withSingleValuedParameter("user").forType(String.class).noDefault()
      .finishMapper(mapper -> mappers[0] = mapper)
      .build();
```

This mapper tree can now be fed with the URI fragments visited by the users:

```
mapperTree.interpretFragment("profile/user/john.doe")
```

As a result of the interpretation process, the mapper tree resolves the given URI fragment to the action class `ShowUserProfileCommand` provided with the `onAction()` method, instantiates this class and executes it. LetËˆs check out this class:

```
public static class ShowUserProfileCommand implements UriActionCommand {

        ParameterValue<String> user;
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // display the profile page to the user
        }

        @CapturedParameter(mapperName = "profile", parameterName = "user")
        public void setUserName(ParameterValue<String> user) {
            this.userName = userName;
        }
    }
```
