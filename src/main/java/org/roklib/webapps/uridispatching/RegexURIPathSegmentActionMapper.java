/**
 * <p>
 * Special dispatching URI action handler which is not only responsible for handling one particular URI token but
 * handles all tokens matching a predefined regular expression. So instead of only handling URI tokens such as
 * <code>user</code> it could handle all tokens matching the regex <code>user_(\d+)</code>, i. e. user_1, user_17,
 * user_23, and so on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link RegexURIPathSegmentActionMapper} is itself a {@link DispatchingURIPathSegmentActionMapper}, that is, it can have its own
 * sub-handlers to which the responsibility to interpret part of a URI can be passed. To set the action command for this
 * {@link RegexURIPathSegmentActionMapper} in case there are no more URI tokens to be passed to sub-handlers (i. e. the currently
 * interpreted URI directly points to this handler), you use method {@link #setMissingSubMapperCommand(AbstractURIActionCommand)}.
 * </p>
 * <h1>Capturing Groups</h1>
 * <p>
 * The regular expression for this action handler can contain capturing groups in order to capture parts or all of the
 * currently interpreted URI token. The captured values for these capturing groups can be obtained with
 * {@link #getMatchedTokenFragments()}. The set of matched token fragments is updated after each call to
 * {@link #isResponsibleForToken(String)} by the parent handler. This usually happens while in the process of
 * interpreting a visited URI by the {@link URIActionDispatcher}. Note that the array of matched token fragments does
 * not contain {@link Matcher}'s first capturing group holding the entire pattern.
 * </p>
 * <h1>Generating Parameterized Action URIs</h1>
 * <p>
 * When you are generating parameterized action URIs with the {@link #getParameterizedActionURI(boolean)} methods, you
 * have to provide a value for the URI token used to represent this {@link RegexURIPathSegmentActionMapper}. This is done with
 * {@link #setURIToken(String)}. The token set with this method must be able to be successfully matched against the
 * regular expression of this handler. Otherwise, an exception is thrown. If you generate a parameterized action URI
 * without setting the URI token first, the regular expression pattern itself is used as the token verbatim.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if you have defined the following pattern to be used by this handler: <code>user_(\d+)</code> and this
 * handler is registered as a sub-handler for another action handler with the action name <code>profile</code>. Calling
 * {@link #getParameterizedActionURI(boolean)} without setting the URI token first will then yield the following URI
 * <code>http://www.example.com/profile/user_(\d+)</code>. Setting this handler's URI token to <code>user_123</code>
 * will instead yield the URI <code>http://www.example.com/profile/user_123</code>. The URI token has to be defined for
 * every {@link RegexURIPathSegmentActionMapper} that is found on the path from the action handler tree's root to some action
 * handler for which a parameterized action URI is to be generated.
 * </p>
